This repository is forked from Codevolution(gopinav) https://github.com/gopinav/Angular-Forms-Tutorial repository. 

It hass been upgraded from Angular v6 to Angular v17 so the Angular Form concepts remain intact even today.

Codevolution Youtube channel is the place from where I learnt the Angular in 2020. Even right now, it is one of my go to places if I want to refresh something.

So I took up this upgrade project so that anyone looking at those tutorials in 2024 should not struggle to run the code.

Angular form concepts taught in those videos are still relevant today. This is the link to full Youtube playlist.
